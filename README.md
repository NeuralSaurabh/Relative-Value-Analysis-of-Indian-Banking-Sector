# Relative Value Analysis of Indian Banking Sector
# 📋 Project Overview
This project performs a comprehensive relative value analysis on major Indian banking stocks using synthetic financial data. The analysis explores valuation metrics, fundamental performance indicators, and implements machine learning models to assess banking sector performance and inter-bank relationships.

# Key Features
Synthetic Data Generation: Creates realistic financial data for major Indian banks

Exploratory Data Analysis: Comprehensive statistical summaries and visualization

Feature Engineering: Creates technical indicators, valuation multiples, and lag features

Machine Learning Modeling: Implements Random Forest regression with time-series validation

Relative Value Analysis: Examines P/B spread z-scores between banking pairs

# 🏦 Banks Analyzed
HDFC Bank

ICICI Bank

State Bank of India (SBI)

Kotak Mahindra Bank (KOTAK)

Axis Bank (AXIS)

# 📊 Data Structure
Synthetic Data Generation
The project generates synthetic daily and quarterly financial data including:

Daily: Closing prices, returns, moving averages

Quarterly: EPS, Book Value Per Share, NIM (Net Interest Margin), GNPA (Gross Non-Performing Assets), Total Assets, Net Income, Shares Outstanding

Time Period
Start Date: January 1, 2022

End Date: January 31, 2025

Frequency: Business days for prices, quarterly for fundamentals

# 🔧 Technical Implementation
Environment Setup

# Output Directory
OUT_DIR = "/mnt/data"
Feature Engineering
The project creates 25 engineered features including:

Return Metrics: Daily returns, log returns, rolling return statistics

Technical Indicators: 20-day and 60-day moving averages, volatility measures

Valuation Multiples: P/E, P/B, P/ABV ratios

Fundamental Changes: NIM and GNPA differences

Lag Features: Price lags at 1, 5, and 20 days

# 📈 Analysis Components
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Summary statistics per bank (first/last values, means, standard deviations)

Key metrics: Closing prices, EPS, Book Value, NIM, GNPA

Visualizations of price trends and spreads

2. Machine Learning Modeling
Model: Random Forest Regressor

Validation: Time-series cross-validation

Target: Closing price prediction using engineered features

Evaluation Metrics: Mean Squared Error (MSE), R² Score

3. Relative Value Analysis
P/B Spread Analysis: Calculates z-scores between bank pairs

Trading Signals:

Entry signals: Z-score > 2.0 (long/short)

Exit signals: Z-score < 0.5 or > -0.5

Visualization: Z-score time series with signal thresholds
